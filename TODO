== necessary before "done"
fix focusbox stealing mouse events (you can't click on the focused square
  to switch direction anymore since the focusbox gets the click, and it
  also steals the focus when you click on the console entry box twice)
allow indexing a whole tree of puzzle files (like we have right now)
finish /session and /crossword puzzle selection
let you choose a new puzzle after you've finished one in a session
eliminate vertical scroll bar in a non-crappy manner -- see handleResize()
  in crossword.html
figure out a way to handle all these users who can't see the chat due
  to a small screen
fix caching (of crossword js)
add a way to give up in singleplayer mode

== nice features
make user roster less empty (maybe show percentage contribution to puzzle?)
web2.0-style "flash" highlighting changes to the puzzle
"googling" support:  [foo bar] does the query and notifies others, and also
  some way to paste in the snippet results
typing a number should go to that clue (maybe not necessary, since you can
  just hit '.' to go to a clue that someone refers to in chat)
figure out some way to handle accidental answer-stealing:
  imagine A has typed in CORRECT and B comes over and types in MYGUESS; then
  once they realize that CORRECT was correct, B will get credit for all of
  that except the E.  (maybe we could track for each cell who was the first
  to get it right?)
don't linkify clues that don't exist
fix safari label support :(

== perpetually needs checking with each new version
fix ffox/win memory leak
investigate cpu usage
